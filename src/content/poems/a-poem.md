In the quiet of the night,
where code and dreams take flight,
the screen's soft glow
casts shadows on the wall.

<!-- more -->

Lines of thought, like rivers flow,
through valleys deep and mountains tall.
Each keystroke a whisper,
each function a call.

The compiler hums its gentle tune,
as bugs are caught beneath the moon.
And in the morning light,
the program runs just right.

Like nature's perfect symmetry,
the code finds its harmony.
A dance of logic, pure and bright,
in the quiet of the night.
