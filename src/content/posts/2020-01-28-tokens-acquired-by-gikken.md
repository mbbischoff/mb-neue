> Of course, we didn't purchase it to shut down or leave unchanged, so we're planning a major makeover – Tokens 2.
> 
> Most importantly, Tokens will finally start supporting IAP promo codes! On top of that, we'll refresh the look and make an iOS app to make it possible to generate codes on the go.

Great news for such a useful developer tool that’s been missing from my toolbelt for a while. My only question is whether Apple will approve the iOS app.
