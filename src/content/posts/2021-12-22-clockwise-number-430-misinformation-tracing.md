I was thrilled to guest on episode [#430 the Clockwise podcast](https://www.relay.fm/clockwise/430) today where we talked about the last apps we purchased, how we’d handle third-party payment options on our Apple devices, our experience with Exposure Notifications, and how we track our resolutions, themes, and habits for the new year. 

Give it a listen and [let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mb/status/1473778126685675520) what your answer would have been to my question: <q>What apps or systems do you use to track your progress toward your resolutions/themes/habits you’re trying to work on in 2022?</q>
