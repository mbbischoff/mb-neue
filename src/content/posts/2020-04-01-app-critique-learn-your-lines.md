title: 'App Critique: Learn Your Lines!'
pubDate: '2020-04-01'
description: As I [mentioned the other day](https://matthewbischoff.com/app-critique/),
  I’m bringing back my App Critique video series, and the first submission is the
  app *[Learn Your Lines!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-your-lines/id1433138502)*
  from [Andrew Cote](https://twitter.com/andrewthecope). In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UN1TR5SfvY),
  I walk through the app as a brand new user and point out some potential areas for
  improvement in the app’s UX and UI.
