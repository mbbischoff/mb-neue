Since starting on the site redesign last year, I’ve known I wanted the website to have a *[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)*:

> Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
> 
> Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business. For short, people just call it a “contact page”.
> 
> So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.

I finally had some *(quaran)*time to make one this weekend, so if you’re ever curious what I’m up to, you can now visit [/now](https://matthewbischoff.com/now).
