description: I’m extremely tempted to spend the $50 on this nifty application that
  claims to document and expose nearly 100% of the SwiftUI API and make it super easy
  to learn. Apple’s own docs are still sorely lacking at this point with 60% of the
  framework being completely undocumented. Anyone else try it yet?

I’m extremely tempted to spend the $50 on this nifty application from Arrow Bit SL that claims to document and expose nearly 100% of the SwiftUI API and make it super easy to learn. Apple’s own docs are still sorely lacking at this point with [60% of the framework being completely undocumented](https://nooverviewavailable.com). Anyone else try it yet?
