To be honest, I’ll be elated if I get even _half_ of these things this year. What’re you hoping for from this year’s conference? 

If you’ll be in Cupertino for the event next week, don’t hesitate to [reach out and say hi](/contact)! I’ll be there with my [Lickability](https://lickability.com) business partner, [Brian Capps](http://bcapps.org), from June 10  –  13.
