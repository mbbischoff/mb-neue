I’ve been reading [Daniel Bogan’s](https://waferbaby.com) [Uses This](https://usesthis.com) (*née The Setup*) interview series since I was a teenager. They chronicle interesting people’s hardware and software setups and end up being a fascinating window into the subject’s priorities and tastes when it comes to tools and toys. 

[My own interview](https://usesthis.com/interviews/matthew.bischoff/) just went up on the site, so now you can read all the nerdy details of my setup. Let me know what you think!
