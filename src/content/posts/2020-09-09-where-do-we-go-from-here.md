The latest episode of [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org) details the history of and hopeful future for bathroom design. With a focus on the needs of trans and nonbinary people, Susan Stryker and the other members of a project called [Stalled!](https://www.stalled.online) have recently won a major victory in the International Building Code that will allow for better bathrooms for *everyone*. In her words:

> What I feel is so elegant about the Stalled! public toilet project is that at some level… it doesn’t matter what most people think about trans people. It doesn’t matter if you feel like you should accommodate people with disabilities… The design of the space just solves the problem.
