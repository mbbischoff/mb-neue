<blockquote>
<p>This was the first year in many that I managed to regularly update and publish content on my personal site. In past years I started strong (usually around New Years) with fresh writing, energy, and enthusiasm. But somewhere around February or March, things died off and I could never find that momentum again.</p>
  
<p>Why was this year different? In this post I've tried to tease apart factors that made writing and editing easier this time around – hopefully there's something in here that may be useful for your own personal website.</p>

Like Brian writes here, for me 2020 was the year that my personal website saw some regular updates. Looking forward to 2021, I plan to keep up the momentum and increase the number of long-form posts here.
