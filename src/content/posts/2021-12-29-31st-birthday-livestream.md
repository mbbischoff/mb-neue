Well, I’m doing it again.

Last year for my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday, [we raised over $7,000 for charity](https://matthewbischoff.com/30th-birthday/) on a super fun livestream. This year, I’ll once again be gathering some pals online and streaming Jackbox Games to raise money for [The Audre Lorde Project](https://translifeline.org):

> The Audre Lorde Project is a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit, Trans and Gender Non Conforming People of Color center for community organizing, focusing on the New York City area. Through mobilization, education and capacity-building, we work for community wellness and progressive social and economic justice. Committed to struggling across differences, we seek to responsibly reflect, represent and serve our various communities.

They do great work in my city, and I hope you consider donating.

*Join us tonight 12/29 at 8 PM ET / 5 PM PT [over on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/matthewbischoff) and [donate here](http://bit.ly/helpaudre).*
