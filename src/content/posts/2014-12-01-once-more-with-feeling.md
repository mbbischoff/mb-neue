For years now this website has merely pointed people to my profiles on other websites and social media services. It wasn’t always that way. In the past, it housed my blog, a podcast I hosted, and even a photoblog at one point. Remember those?

**It’s time to make this place my own again.** A place to put the things I write and make. And more than that, a place to experiment.

Inspired by my [heroes](http://frankchimero.com/blog/homesteading-2014/) and my [friends](http://khanlou.com), I’ve decided to write under my name. And while I expect that what’s here will change a lot of over time, I’ll try not to break too many links along the way.

If you want to come along for the ride, [subscribe in your feed reader](/feed/), and if you want to know more about the person who’s writing this, there’s an [about page](/about/).
