pubDate: '2020-04-05'
description: 'A very persuasive essay from Maciej Cegłowski, the founder of Pinboard,
  about the whys and hows of wearing masks in public. I started wearing one yesterday
  for the limited time I was outside, and the medical community seems to now be recommending
  that everyone do the same. It’s also worth reading [Ben Thompson’s take](https://stratechery.com/2020/unmasking-twitter/)
  and checking out these [simple mask-making instructions](https://ragmask.com) from
  Loren Brichter.  '

> On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control [recommended that every American wear a face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) when in public. Masks will be the hot, bold look for summer.
> 
> The medical evidence for the practice is overwhelming. The post-SARS countries in East Asia have known this for a long time, and America and Europe are finally coming around. I've put a bunch of resources about the medical benefits of mask wearing in a further [reading section](https://idlewords.com/2020/04/let_s_all_wear_a_mask.htm#medical_reading) at the bottom of this post.
> 
> But in this essay, I want to persuade you not just to wear a mask, but to go beyond the new CDC guidelines and help make mask wearing a social norm. That means always wearing a mask when you go out in public, and becoming a pest and nuisance to the people in your life until they do the same.
