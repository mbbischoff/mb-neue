  any problem they need solved with an app. People loved it and I loved helping people
  find the perfect software solutions to their quandaries.


  This Friday at 3 PM ET, I’m experimenting with a version of the same thing on Clubhouse.
  Co-hosted by my friend and colleague, Jillian Meehan. It’ll be be a fun, nerdy time

A few years ago, I let folks on Twitter [ask for software recommendations](https://twitter.com/mb/status/893848739437305856) for any problem they need solved with an app. People loved it and I loved helping people find the perfect software solutions to their quandaries.

This Friday at 3 PM ET, I’m experimenting with a version of the same thing on Clubhouse co-hosted by my friend and colleague, [Jillian Meehan](https://jillian.cloud). It’ll be be a fun, nerdy time and we’d love to ~~see~~ hear you there.

PS: If you need a Clubhouse invite, [let me know](/contact) and I’ll send you one.
