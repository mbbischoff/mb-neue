pubDate: '2020-04-13'
description: Iâ€™m not much of a gamer, but I am a nerd about the creative process.
  As such, Iâ€™ve really been enjoying Robin Sloanâ€™s [new video game development newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com/overworld/)
  where he is chronicleing the creation of a game called _Perils of the Overworld_.
  Consider subscribing if youâ€™re nerdy about maps, game making, typography, sound
  design, or interactive fiction. ðŸ—º
