This Friday, I spent an hour and a half chatting with [Matthew Cassinelli](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com) about using Appleâ€™s Shortcuts app to simplify my work and life. We went through 13 of my 156 shortcuts, showing how they work, explaining how I built them, and answering questions from the chat. As promised on the stream, here are 5 of those shortcuts that I use every day, with a brief explanation of why they save me so much time and links to download them.

### ðŸ“¡ File a Radar

As a power user of Apple software and developer of apps for their platform, I have a lot of, shall we say, *feedback*. So whenever I run into a [paper cut bug](/software-paper-cuts/) or an API I wish existed, I run this shortcut to file a new feedback report (nÃ©e [radar](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Radar)) and then pray it gets addressed in a future OS update.

### ðŸ’» Change Mac Wallpaper

My MacBook sports a daily random [wallpaper](http://gum.co/afzw) illustrated by the supremely talented artist [David Lanham](https://www.dlanham.com/), whom Iâ€™ve followed for decades. But sometimes, macOS chooses an image that doesnâ€™t fit the dayâ€™s mood. Itâ€™s times like these I run this shortcut to have the OS change my wallpaper to another random image from Davidâ€™s collection without waiting for the following day when it will refresh again. The clever AppleScript it uses was written by a user of the MacWorld forum.

### ðŸ—“ Move Calendar Events

I [hyperschedule](https://www.relay.fm/automators/1) my day in [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical), blocking out events for everything from work meetings to workouts to leisure reading. But sometimes, I get delayed (or overly ambitious), and I need to shift a whole bunch of events later in the day. Thatâ€™s where this shortcut comes in. Itâ€™s so much faster than tapping through every event individually. Tell it how long you want to delay things, tap the events you want to move, and youâ€™re done.

### ðŸ’¬ Update Slack Status

We use Slack statuses at [Lickability](http://lickability.com) to communicate all kinds of things: lunch breaks, doctorâ€™s appointments, vacations, and more. This handy shortcut from Jake Bathman, which Iâ€™ve lightly customized, lets me update my Slack status from anywhere without even opening the Slack app. And itâ€™s even better than that! I can even use it from *within* other shortcuts to automate my status. Jake has written a [detailed setup guide](https://medium.com/@jakebathman/setting-up-a-slack-app-for-use-with-ios-shortcuts-e8e16b15d0f3) that makes it super simple to use.

### ðŸ”‹ Power Down

At the end of the workday, I like to step away from my desk and start unwinding. I run this shortcut from a button on my [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-xl). It quits all my apps, turns on my favorite screensaver, and mutes my computer so notification sounds donâ€™t draw me back into work. A little simple ritual for leaving my Mac how I want it for the next day.

Thatâ€™s all for now! I hope these shortcuts speed up your workflows as much as they have mine. If you enjoyed this post, [let me know on Twitter]( https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@mb), and maybe Iâ€™ll share more in the future.
